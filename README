(AndDiSa | Android | Adb) Remote Toolkit

is a toolkit which helps to manage Android devices remotely, i.e. from your PC.
The toolkit is written using the Java language, i.e. it's running not depending on
a specific operating system as long there is a Java runtime environment available.

Currently only a command line version of ART is available, i.e. there is no gui yet :-(.

There are several application modes available:
==============================================
-backup
	back up parts / all of your android device
	
-devices
	prints list of available devices
	
-info
	prints detailed info about connected device
	
-restore
 	restores a backup to device (currently not implemented)


Beside the application modes, there are some options which influence the behaviour
-bd,--baseDir <arg>
	defines the base directory to backup to / restore from
	(default is current directory)

-h,--help
	print help overview
	
-i,--image
	use image mode for backup / restore

-pif,--partitionInfoFile <arg>
	provide a partition information file which is used for identifying the parttions / file systems

-s,--serial <arg>
	connect to the device with serial number
	
-t,--tar
	use tar mode for backup / restore
	
-td,--tooldir <arg>
	define path to tools directory where adb / fastboot are located
	(if not provided, adb and fastboot must be in the users path)

-tsf,--timeStampFormat <arg>
	create a timestamped sub directory in backup mode using format (e.g. 'yyyy-MM-dd-hh-mm')

Examples:
=========

List connected devices

	$ art.sh -devices
	connected devices:
	123ee2274abc11

Backup recovery partition of device as an image

	$ art.sh -backup -i -td /export/toolsdir/ -bd /backups -tsf yyyy-MM-dd-hh-mm RECOVERY
	transferring /backups/2013-03-20-20-00/RECOVERY.img...................finished
	size: 8193939 
	transferring /backups/2013-03-20-20-00/RECOVERY.img.md5.finished
	size:37

	btw.: a md5 verification takes place!
